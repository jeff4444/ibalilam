# Email Setup for Contact Seller Feature

## Current Status
The contact seller feature is now fully implemented with proper API endpoints and form handling, but **actual email sending is not yet configured**. Currently, emails are logged to the console for testing purposes.

## What's Working
✅ **API Route**: `/api/contact-seller` handles email requests  
✅ **Form Validation**: Proper form validation and error handling  
✅ **Reply-To Setup**: Email includes buyer's email as reply-to  
✅ **User Authentication**: Requires logged-in user  
✅ **Seller Lookup**: Fetches seller information from database  
✅ **Loading States**: Proper loading and success/error states  

## What Needs Setup
❌ **Email Service**: Actual email delivery service (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)  
❌ **Environment Variables**: Email service API keys  
❌ **Email Templates**: Professional email formatting  

## To Enable Real Email Sending

### Option 1: Using Resend (Recommended)
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Uncomment and update the Resend code in `/app/api/contact-seller/route.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY)
   await resend.emails.send({
     from: 'noreply@yourdomain.com', // Must be verified domain
     to: sellerUser.user.email,
     replyTo: user.email,
     subject: emailSubject,
     text: emailBody,
   })
   ```

### Option 2: Using SendGrid
1. Sign up at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Install SendGrid: `npm install @sendgrid/mail`
5. Update the API route to use SendGrid instead

## Email Features
- **Reply-To**: Set to buyer's email for direct communication
- **Subject**: Prefixed with `[Techafon]` for identification
- **Content**: Includes buyer info, part details, and message
- **Professional**: Includes footer with platform branding

## Testing
Currently, all email attempts are logged to the console. Check your server logs to see the email content that would be sent.

## Security
- Requires user authentication
- Validates all input fields
- Uses server-side API route (not client-side)
- Includes proper error handling
